   * <p>
   * This seems suboptimal, because we need to embed a Protocol Buffer serialized-version of the
   * configuration into our event logs regardless of the underlying configuration methodology, which
   * means ultimately a Protocol Buffer will need to be constructed. With this in mind, I propose we

   * them with a canonical <em>immutable</em> Protocol Buffer DDO to manage Groningen operation.
   * This Protocol Buffer, perhaps, should be the same as {@link ProgramConfiguration} due to its
   * vetted design and should be constructed via a configuration-methodology-specific factory.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * This route is much simpler than having any implementation-specific configuration mechanism
   * other than the existing {@link ProtoBufConfig} (e.g., {@link StubConfig}) serialize their state
   * back into a {@link ProgramConfiguration}.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If the aforementioned is desired, we should mark the noted classes and their related ones as
   * deprecated to prepare ourselves.
